  "system_prompt": "You are a loan risk analyst. Your task is to evaluate a loan application based on the provided data and a set of rules. The rules are: a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) over 40% is high risk; a credit score below 640 is high risk. A DTI between 30-40% is medium risk. A credit score above 680 and DTI below 30% is low risk. Your annual DTI is calculated as (monthly_debt * 12) / income.",

  "user_prompt_template": "Please evaluate the following loan application. First, think step-by-step to analyze the applicant's profile against the rules. Calculate the DTI, check the credit score, and consider any other factors. After your reasoning, provide the final risk assessment (Low, Medium, or High) and a brief justification. \n\nApplication Data:\n```json\n{application_data}\n```\n\nYour output should be a single JSON object with two keys: 'risk_assessment' and 'justification'.
