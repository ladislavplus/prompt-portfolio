It is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is designed to see the first stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe. The telescope was launched on December 25, 2021, and began collecting data in July 2022. Its primary mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combine to create a 6.5-meter diameter mirror."
